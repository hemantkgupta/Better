# Java Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains a collection of Java programs implementing various algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

The code in this repository is organized into directories based on topic. Each directory contains Java programs related to a specific algorithm, data structure, or problem-solving platform.

Notable directories include:
- **HackerEarth**: Contains solutions to problems from HackerEarth.
- **TestProject**: Contains sample projects or test code.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install and set up the project.

## Usage

The Java programs in this repository can be compiled and run using any standard Java compiler (e.g., `javac`).

Most of the code is organized into packages. You can import these packages into your own Java projects to use the implemented algorithms and data structures.

For example, to compile a file:
```bash
javac YourFile.java
```

To run a compiled Java class:
```bash
java YourFile
```

If the code is part of a package, you'll need to include the package structure in your commands and ensure your classpath is set up correctly. For example, if `YourFile.java` is in the package `com.example`:

To compile:
```bash
javac com/example/YourFile.java
```

To run:
```bash
java com.example.YourFile
```

## Contributing
